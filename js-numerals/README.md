# Dear Digital Natives!

This is my take on the task you gave me, where I had to make an Arabic number conversion tool.

For this project I used React with styled-components as a CSS preprocessor.

The site contains a Header, a Footer and a Hero page, where you can type your number of choosing and it automatically will give you back the number as text. For a placeholder the number '123' is already being added in the input field.

The logo is created with the help of Adobe.

All the tests I ran came back as 'passed'.

If you have any questions please let me know!
